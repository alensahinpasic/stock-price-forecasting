Predicting Stock Price Changes Using Machine Learning Models

Microsoft (2010–2024)

This project applies machine learning models to forecast daily percentage changes in Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices using historical data from 2010 to 2024.

## 🔍 Overview
- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Features: High/Low difference, Close/Open difference, Lag_1 to Lag_10
- Target: Adjusted Close Percentage Change
- Tools: scikit-learn, RandomizedSearchCV, yfinance

## 📈 Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved best performance: R² ≈ 0.43
- Feature importance: Close-Open difference and lagged returns were most predictive
- Models significantly outperformed baseline (Lag_1)

## 📊 Evaluation
- Metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
- TimeSeriesSplit used to avoid data leakage
- Residual analysis and feature importance visualizations included

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, seaborn
- Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`)

## 📄 Full Report
See [Final_Report_ML.pdf](Final_Report_ML.pdf) for full methodology, results, and visualizations.
